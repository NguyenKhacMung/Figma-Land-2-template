PSG requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v4+ to run. after making sure that it's installed on your device, follow the commands.

```sh
$ cd psg-starter
$ npm i
$ npm run build
$ npm start
```

after executing the above commands, if everything goes well with you, your default browser will be automatically opened and navigating to the server which just created locally.

From this point, we finished running the project.. Feel free to apply any changes and watcher will start running. the hot reload server is ready and the dist/ directory well be hosted as default âœ”.
